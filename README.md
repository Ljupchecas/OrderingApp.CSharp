# OrderingApp.CSharp
Developed a console application for personal task management, offering a convenient interface for creating, assigning, and tracking tasks efficiently.

This application serves as a centralized task management system, facilitating efficient coordination and collaboration among team members. Upon launching the application, users are greeted with a user-friendly menu, offering options to view existing tasks, create new tasks, assign tasks to team members, and update task statuses.

The application leverages a static database to store task information, ensuring data persistence across sessions. Additionally, a static text helper class is employed to handle user interactions and display messages, enhancing the overall usability of the application.

One of the notable features of this application is its ability to showcase task statistics on the main menu, providing insights into the overall progress of the project. For instance, users can see how many tasks have been completed or are currently in progress, offering valuable metrics for project management.

To ensure data integrity and security, the application employs encapsulation by implementing customer getter and setter methods for critical properties. This enhances the reliability and maintainability of the codebase while adhering to best practices in object-oriented programming.

Although this application was developed as a learning project, it represents a significant milestone in my journey as a developer. It provided valuable hands-on experience in C# programming and console application development, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios. While there may be room for improvement, the application stands as a testament to my dedication to continuous learning and improvement in software development.
